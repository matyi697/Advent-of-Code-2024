# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges implemented in C/C++.

## Project Structure

Each day's challenge is implemented in its own directory, named `Day XX`, where `XX` is the day of the month (e.g., `Day 1` for December 1st). Each directory contains:
- A `task1.cpp / task2.cpp` file with the solution for that day's problem
- Input files (if applicable), typically named `input.txt`
- Additional utility files or libraries if required
